This repository presents a basic, surface-level simulation of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution protocol,created for 
educational and conceptual understanding of quantum cryptography. The currently uploaded files demonstrate the core ideas 
such as quantum bit encoding, basis selection, key sifting, and basic eavesdropping detection. This version is an initial 
implementation. The complete and finalized project will be uploaded soon after confirmation and approval from my project guide.
